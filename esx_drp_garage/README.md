# esx_drp_garage

Custom Garage for ESX
This was originally modified for Dream Roleplay Serious rp server.
Garage only takes into account vehicles purchased in the dealership and also vehicles that have been stored or taken out.

## Download & Installation

### Using Git
```
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/lilfuchs/esx_drp_garage [esx]/esx_drp_garage
```

### Manually
- Download https://github.com/lilfuchs/esx_drp_garage/archive/master.zip
- Put it in the `[esx]` directory

## Installation

```

## How it works:
Enter the green circle on foot to enter a vehicle, enter the red circle with your vehicle to store it if the vehicle is damaged a menu announces the amount of the bill you can pay to enter the vehicle or go see a mechanic.
